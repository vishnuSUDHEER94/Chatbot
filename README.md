The purpose of the chatbot is to make a conversation between both humans and machine. Chatbots 
were initially made using the concepts of machine learning
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it had some
flaws in it. In order to overcome those problems, we are
using some deep learning techniques with NLP to create
an advance chatbot.
